## Overview

This is a Computer Vision classes prepared for the 2nd-year M.D. students.
Course includes topics covering basic areas of computer vision. 
It takes 8 seminars-discussion lessons and 8 practical lessons.
Most practical lessons will be based on using of the OpenCV v3. library.
All materials and tasks will be hosted in this repository and available for all students. All program code is written under Visual Studio 2015 with v120 toolset.
